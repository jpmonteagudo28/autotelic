Its lack of discernment renders him dangerous and vulnerable to the work of evil agents. \n\n* Statistical models are like golems, set up and commanded by truth to obey without complaints but unable to discern context and usefulness. \n\n* A clear and urgent need for a unified theory of statistics that allows for flexibility and freedom in designing, building and refining special-purpose statistical procedures. Classic statistics tests are rigid and applicable to only a handful of procedures; but even those tests that offer more flexibility, like **ordinary linear regression** relies on strong assumptions that lead to catastrophic results if violated.\n\n### The Monster of Deductive Falsification (DF)\n\n* DF is impossible in nearly every scientific context:\n  - NHST is not falsificationist since it doesn't falsify the research hypothesis, but the null of no effect. \n  - Hypothesis are not models. One hypothesis may be represented by many different models, and nay given statistical model may correspond to more than one hypothesis. \n  - Possible solution: Compare more than one model. All statistical tests are also models.\n  \n### The Weapons of the Fight\n\n* Bayesian data analysis\n  - count the number of ways things can happen, according to your assumptions.\n  - Randomness is a property of information, not the world.\n* Multilevel models\n  - The Earth stands on the back of an elephant, which stands on the back of a turtle. Where does the turtle stand? “It's turtles all the way down”…for us it's parameters all the way down.\n  - **Multilevel regression deserves to be the default form of regression**\n  - To adjust estimates for repeat sampling\n  - To adjust estimates for imbalance in sampling\n  - To study variation\n  - To avoid averaging\n* Model comparison using uniform criteria\n  - Model comparison based on future predictive accuracy\n  \n### Where to Go from Here?\n\n * **Chapter 2 and 3** - foundation Bayesian inference tools\n * **Chapter 4 - 7** - build multiple linear regression as Bayesian tools.\n * **Chapter 8 - 11** - generalized linear models:\n    - Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)\n    - Maximum Entropy\n    - Model details\n * **Chapter 12 - 14** - Multilevel models, linear and generalized, missing data, measurement error, and spatial correlation. \n * **Chapter 15** - returns to some of the issues raised in Chapter 1. \n \n## Chapter 2 - Small Worlds and Large Worlds\n\nChristopher Colombo miscalculated the diameter of the earth– he thought it was smaller (30,000 km instead of 40,000), landed in the Bahamas and discover a new world. \n\n* The model is the small world, and we hope to deploy it in the large world of reality and be useful. \n* Bayesian models are optimal in small worlds, but need to be demonstrated rather than logically deduced in large worlds. \n\n### The garden of forking data\n\n* Consider everything that could have happened.\n\n1. Count the possibilities\n2. Use prior information \n    - from previous data\n    - knowledge of how the process works\n    - Act as if you had prior information\n        * multiply the prior count by the new count\n        * When we have previous information suggesting there are $W_{prior}$ ways for a conjecture\n        to produce a previous observation $D_{prior}$ and,\n        * We acquire new observations $D_{new}$ then the same conjecture can produce in $W_{new}$ ways\n        * the number of ways the conjecture can account for $D_{prior}$ and $D_{new}$ is the product of \n        $W_{prior} \\times W_{new}$.\n        \n\n\n",
