# Let's create some made-up factor variables, Quality of Product 
# and Performance of the product on a scale from 1 - 5 and 1 - 4. 

df <- data.frame(Qual = factor(rep(1:5,each = 20), 
                          labels = c("Strongly Agree", 
                                     "Agree",

# Now let's calculate the correlation between these two variables

poly_cor <- polycor::polychor(df$Qual, df$Perform, ML = FALSE)

# [1] .993 This is the correlation estimate for our data. 
# Performance and Quality are strongly correlated.
